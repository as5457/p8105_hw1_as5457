## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Problem 1
Creating a data frame comprised of a random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution


```{r random_sample}
library (tidyverse)

set.seed(1)

rand_samp = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 5)
)

rand_samp
```


Creating a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
```{r}
vector_logical = rand_samp > 2
vector_logical
```
