# Problem 1
Creating a data frame comprised of a random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution


```{r random_sample}
library (tidyverse)

set.seed(1)

rand_samp = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 5)
)

rand_samp
```


Creating a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
```{r logic_vector}
vector_logical_rand = rand_samp > 2
vector_logical_rand
```
